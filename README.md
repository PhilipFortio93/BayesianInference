# Wiener Filter via Messenger Field and Bayesian Inference

The analytical solution to the wiener filter involves matrix division which becomes infeasable for large data sets. Instead
we use an interrim messenger field to iteratively simulate the action of the wiener filter by transferring information 
between two different domains in which the noise and signal covariance become sparse. 

Set parameters in messengerfield.py <br />
run python messengerfield.py <br />
